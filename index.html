    <div id="articleTop" class="article-title">Have you had an accident at work?</div>
    <div class="article-text-right">
        In 2016 there were <mark class="nonfatal">2.9 million non-fatal</mark> workplace injuries and illnesses reported
        by private industry employers, a rate of 2.9 cases per 100 full-time employees. 892,270 of those reported
        resulted in days off work - on average, 8 - This probably won't surpise
        you, as it's a situation many people have been in.
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-left">
        An unwelcome shock however is the fact that in the same year a total of <mark class='fatal'>5,190 people lost their lives at work</mark>
        in the USA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics highlighted that it was the third consecutive increase in annual workplace
        fatalities, and the first time more than 5,000 fatalities have been recorded by the Census of Fatal Occupational
        Injuries (CFOI) since 2008.

    <div class="article-text-center">
        So who are these workers? Is the risk of the job worth the reward? And what's causing these accidents?

            Generally, industries with a high injury rate have a high workplace fatality rate - but those with a high fatality rate
            may not correspond to a high injury rate.
            <p></p>
            Workers in occupations involving manual labouring - such as Farming, Construction or Transpotation - have accident
            rates far above the national average.

        The cause of injury in accidents also varies significantly depending on the overall severity of the accident.
        <mark class='trans'>Transportation Incidents</mark> accounted for well over a third of deaths at work in 2016, but were much less often the cause
        of a non-fatal injury. Conversely, <mark class='oabr'>Overexertion and Bodily Reaction</mark> led the field for injuries in the workplace, but
        in no cases led to a death at work.
