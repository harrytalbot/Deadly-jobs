        In 2016 there were 2.9 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses reported
        by private industry employers, a rate of 2.9 cases per 100 full-time employees. 892,270 of those reported
        resulted in days off work - on average, 8 - This probably won't surpise

        The cause of injury in accidents also varies significantly depending on the overall severity of the accident.
        <transInc>'Transportation Incidents'</transInc> accounted for well over a third of deaths at work in 2016, but were much less often the cause
